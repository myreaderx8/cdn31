been around for 10 years. And because a birthday sounds like a good opportunity to share some metrics, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efounders.com\/companies\">portfolio companies<\/a> have reached a valuation of $2 billion together \u2014&nbsp;only 18 months after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/08\/startup-studio-efounders-has-a-portfolio-valuation-of-1-billion\/\">reaching<\/a> $1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>eFounders says it is focused on building the future of work. In practical terms, it means the company is building B2B SaaS startups with a focus on productivity and workflows. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/frontapp.com\">Front<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/aircall.io\">Aircall<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spendesk.com\">Spendesk<\/a> all started with eFounders.<\/p>\n<p>There have been a few exits, such as TextMaster, Mention, Mailjet, Hivy and Briq. Those exits are included in the total valuation of eFounders companies \u2014&nbsp; exit values are freezed as of date of exit. But Front, Aircall and Spendesk could represent even more massive successes down the road.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhen we started in 2011, there was an existing model that was Rocket Internet. We liked the entrepreneurship spirit but we didn\u2019t like the philosophy,\u201d co-founder and CEO Thibaud Elzi\u00e8re told me.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of copying Rocket Internet altogether, they altered the business model quite drastically on three different aspects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They try to come up with original startup ideas, not copycats;<\/li>\n<li>They want to work with entrepreneurs, not consultants-turned-entrepreneurs;<\/li>\n<li>Their portfolio companies should be able to operate on their own after 12 to 18 months.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When eFounders come up with a new project, they act as a sort of third co-founder. The startup studio tries to find a CEO and a CTO. In exchange for a third of equity, the eFounders core team helps take the project off the ground. When the startup raises a seed round, eFounders moves on from day-to-day activities and focuses on new projects.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s been working well. With 30 portfolio companies, there are now 1,500 people working for an eFounders-backed company. Combined, they generate $131 million in annual recurring revenue.<\/p>\n<p>As for the next 10 years, Elzi\u00e8re doesn\u2019t think eFounders can simply increase the cadence and launch more and more projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a model that isn\u2019t scalable \u2014 it\u2019s hand crafted,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to expand. First, eFounders is going to focus on more verticals. That\u2019s why the startup studio partnered with Camille Tyan so that he would be in charge of fintech projects. You can imagine another studio for blockchain startups, another one for AI startups, etc.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to remain focused on software with a B2B angle \u2014 not enterprise but long-tail B2B. We don\u2019t pretend to be a general-purpose studio, but we can acquire specific skills and knowledge on specific topics,\u201d Elzi\u00e8re said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"p3aXp6TYCI\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/saas-startup-studio-efounders-launches-a-fintech-startup-studio\/\">SaaS startup studio eFounders launches a fintech startup studio<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SaaS startup studio eFounders launches a fintech startup studio&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/saas-startup-studio-efounders-launches-a-fintech-startup-studio\/embed\/#?secret=p3aXp6TYCI\" data-secret=\"p3aXp6TYCI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>If there are some liquidity events with some of the most successful eFounders companies, the startup studio is also going to use part of its cash to invest in other companies.

class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The influence of a founder<\/span> on their company&#8217;s culture cannot be overstated. Everything from their views on the product and business to how they think about people affects how their company&#8217;s employees will behave, and since behavior in turn informs culture, the consequences of a founder&#8217;s early decisions can be far-reaching.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s not very surprising that Expensify has its own take on almost everything it does when you consider what its founder and CEO David Barrett learned early in his life: &#8220;Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.&#8221; As we saw in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/10\/expensify-ec1-origin\/\">part 1 of this EC-1<\/a>, this led him to the revelation that it&#8217;s easier to figure things out for yourself than finding advice that applies to you. Eventually, these insights \u2014 and the adventurous P2P hacker attitude he nurtured alongside his colleagues and Travis Kalanick at Red Swoosh \u2014 would inform how he would go about shaping Expensify.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tExpensify&#8217;s culture can&#8217;t be separated from its hiring and growth processes \u2014 by joining the company, employees self-select into a group that isn&#8217;t likely to get hung up about trade-offs.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s striking how Expensify has managed to maintain this character 13 years later, even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210503005265\/en\">on the threshold of an IPO<\/a>. How did this happen? During a series of interviews in February and early March, we found the answer is tied to the level of thought and effort this expense management business puts into its culture.<\/p>\n<p>You see, the people at Expensify are prepared to invent their own playbook, develop it and, if needed, rewrite it completely. Its HR policies and strategy are tailored to find people who would have fun building an expense management product. It has a unique growth and recognition scheme to offset the drawbacks of a flat organizational structure. It&#8217;s even got a &#8220;Senate&#8221; that vets all major decisions. No kidding.<\/p>\n<p>All this, and more, has ultimately helped Expensify reach more than 10 million users and achieve <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/24\/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups\/\">$100 million in annual revenue<\/a> with just 130 employees. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at how Expensify makes it happen.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;We want the fewest people necessary to get the job done&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear Expensify&#8217;s unusually high employee-to-revenue ratio is intentional: &#8220;We want the fewest people necessary to get the job done,&#8221; Barrett says. But how do you actually achieve it? How do you hire and keep people who can deliver such results? Barrett had to learn how the hard way.<\/p>\n<p>Expensify&#8217;s first team was based in San Francisco and comprised Barrett&#8217;s old Red Swoosh and Akamai colleagues, who joined a few months after Akamai fired him. A small team was enough to get started, but it was much more difficult to hire additional people. Barrett is eager to clarify the Valley is not really the best place to recruit talent: &#8220;Sure, Silicon Valley has a ton of really awesome people, but all of them have jobs!,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The influence of a founder on their company&#8217;s culture cannot be overstated.

new assistant can automatically transcribe your Zoom meetings"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A.I.-powered voice transcription service <a href=\"https:\/\/otter.ai\/\">Otter.ai<\/a> wants to make it even easier for its business users to record their meetings. The company is today introducing a new feature, Otter Assistant, which can automatically join the Zoom meetings on your calendar, transcribe the conversations, and share the notes with other participants. Though Otter.ai is already integrated with Zoom, the assistant is designed to make using transcription something you don&#8217;t have to constantly remember to enable at the meeting&#8217;s start or stop at the end, while also serving as a place where participants can collaborate by asking questions, sharing photos and more, as the meeting is underway.<\/p>\n<p>The feature also works around the earlier limitation with Zoom, where only the meeting host could use the Otter.ai integration directly.<\/p>\n<p>The idea to automate meeting transcription makes sense for the remote work environment <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/boosted-by-the-pandemic-meeting-transcription-service-otter-ai-raises-50m\/\">created by the pandemic<\/a>, where people have been splitting their time between work, parenting, homeschooling and other duties. This can often lead to meetings where users are pulled away and miss things that had been said. That&#8217;s one area where Otter.ai can help. But it can also help with issues like overlapping meetings, or larger meetings were only a few topics are directly relevant to your work &#8212; but where you&#8217;d like to be able to review the rest of the meeting discussion later, instead of in real-time.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To use the new Otter Assistant, users first synchronize their Google Calendar or Microsoft Calendar with Otter&#8217;s service. The assistant will then automatically join all Zoom meetings going forward, where it appears as an additional meeting participant, for transparency&#8217;s sake.<\/p>\n<p>The assistant also posts a link to the transcription in the Zoom chat for everyone to access. In other words, this is not a feature to use to skip meetings without your boss knowing &#8212; it&#8217;s designed for those times when everyone has already agreed the meeting will be transcribed.<\/p>\n<p>As the meeting continues, attendees can use Otter&#8217;s live transcript to highlight key parts, add photos, and make notes. They can also ask questions via the commenting feature, as opposed to speaking up &#8212; which may be helpful if you&#8217;re in a noisy place at the time of the meeting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jzbRLczOk1w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Once the assistant is enabled, you don&#8217;t have to remember to turn on Otter.ai for each meeting, and you can even use your headphones to listen to the meeting in progress. The Otter Assistant will still be able to record both sides of the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>However, you are able to turn Otter Assistant off on a per-meeting basis via the &#8220;My Agenda&#8221; section on the Otter website, which will include new toggles next to each meeting you have scheduled.<\/p>\n<p>When meetings wrap, you can also have Otter.ai configured to automatically share the meeting notes with all the attendees.<\/p>\n<p>The Otter Assistant is available to Otter.ai Business users, which are <a href=\"https:\/\/otter.ai\/pricing\">upgraded plans <\/a>that start at $20 per month, and include features like two-factor authentication, SOC2 compliance, advanced search, export, custom vocabulary, shared speaker identification, centralized data and billing, and more.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Otter.ai says it has transcribed over 150 million meetings, up from 100 million <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/21\/a-i-powered-transcription-service-otter-ai-can-now-record-from-google-meet\/\">in the beginning of 2021<\/a> . The company doesn&#8217;t provide details on its total subscriber base, but did note earlier it saw a sizable 8x increase in revenues in 2020, leading up to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/boosted-by-the-pandemic-meeting-transcription-service-otter-ai-raises-50m\/\">its $50 million Series B, announced in February.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A.I.-powered voice transcription service Otter.ai wants to make it even easier for its business users to record their meetings.

raised $26M to scale its battery analytics software"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">All batteries degrade over time. For automakers, fleet managers and other companies, the crux \u2014 and key to profitability \u2014 is knowing when they will.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to understand the health and status of a battery without extensive and expensive testing, which isn&#8217;t always possible once a battery is in a vehicle. German battery analytics software company Twaice has been taking aim at this problem since its founding in 2018, and it announced Wednesday that it has raised $26 million in Series B funding led by Chicago-based Energize Ventures. The company, which primarily works in the mobility and energy storage industries, now has a total financing of $45 million.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe started Twaice with the focus on building a battery analytics platform which really covers the whole lifecycle of battery systems,\u201d company co-founder Stephan Rohr told TechCrunch, including the development and operational phases. The company has launched tools that are suited for the design and development phase and when the battery is actually in a vehicle or energy storage system. Audi, Daimler and Hero Motors are some of its customers.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company intends to use this fresh round of funding to expand its European commercial footprint and possibly into the United States. It also wants to build even more use cases on top of its analytics platform \u2013 for example, working with fleet providers, rather than only the manufacturers.<\/p>\n<p>One of the company\u2019s innovations is a concept of a \u201cdigital twin,\u201d or a simulation model of the battery system that runs in Twaice&#8217;s cloud platform. The company continually updates the parameters of the \u2018twin\u2019 so that it reflects the behavior of the actual battery, down to its thermal characteristics, electrical behavior and degradation. That means companies that operate a fleet of EV buses can monitor the state of the battery packs of each of their vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt enables not just a focus on the current health of the battery system, but also it enables us to simulate and forecast the future,\u201d Rohr said.<\/p>\n<p>Twaice also offers solutions before the battery even enters the vehicle or energy storage system. \u201cBattery design engineers use our simulations to reduce the testing effort [. . .] assess charging strategies, assess depth of discharge, assess different cell chemistries,\u201d Rohr explained.<\/p>\n<p>One major use case for Twaice&#8217;s software is for warranty tracking and safety risks. Using battery analytics OEMs can understand where exactly the battery failed, whether in the cell or the module, for example, and also gain valuable data on future warranty claims based on previous data. Warranties are huge risks for OEMs, Lennart Hinrichs, Twaice&#8217;s commercial director explained to TechCrunch, in part because batteries are so complex and difficult to understand once they\u2019re in a vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>But having a grasp on the battery\u2019s life could come in handy for consumers as well. Twaice has partnered with T\u00dcV Rheinland, a testing and certification institute in Germany that\u2019s working on EV resale in the private market. It could eventually lead the way to a standard assessment process for batteries on the resale market.<\/p>\n<p>Once the battery is no longer suited for its first life application, companies can use Twaice&#8217;s software to assess the remaining life and health of the battery system and determine whether it\u2019s fit for a second-life purpose or if it should go straight to recycling.<\/p>\n<p>Twaice&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/25\/battery-analytics-software-startup-twaice-raises-e11m-series-a-led-by-creandum\/\">previous funding round in March 2020<\/a> was led by early-stage venture capital firm Creandum, with additional participation from existing investors\u00a0 UVC Partners, Cherry Ventures and Speedinvest.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RXvsNkTplO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit\/\">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit\/embed\/#?secret=RXvsNkTplO\" data-secret=\"RXvsNkTplO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All batteries degrade over time.

Crosslink Capital led the investment with participation from previous investors Upfront Ventures and One Way Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>The company helps automate permissioning across multiple cloud vendors and software services, whether that involves a human or a machine seeking permission. In a world of increasing automation, it&#8217;s often a machine seeking access, and that makes permissioning all the more critical, says Britive co-founder and CEO Art Poghosyan.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What we offer is an automated approach to access, [moving from] what we call statically granted access, which constantly gets added all the time [&#8230;] to completely &#8216;just in time access&#8217;,&#8221; he said. That means that after you define a policy, it sets the ground rules for access, and grants it based on that policy for the time required, and nothing more, whether you&#8217;re a human or a machine.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"raqjKHOQfe\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/mastercard-is-acquiring-identity-verification-company-ekata-for-850m\/\">Mastercard is acquiring identity verification company Ekata for $850M<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Mastercard is acquiring identity verification company Ekata for $850M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/mastercard-is-acquiring-identity-verification-company-ekata-for-850m\/embed\/#?secret=raqjKHOQfe\" data-secret=\"raqjKHOQfe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In today&#8217;s complex development world that could take many forms including API keys and secrets. &#8220;Yes, sometimes those things are granted to a human actor like a DevOps engineer, but a lot of times it also needs to be granted &#8212; quote, unquote &#8212; to a Terraform script or to GitHub to go and build out application infrastructure or deploy an application,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The company currently has 40 employees, a number that Poghosyan expects to double in the next 12 months as he puts this capital to work. As a first generation Armenian immigrant, Poghosyan says that he takes diversity and inclusion extremely seriously as he hires more employees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always been committed &#8212; in this business and our previous startup &#8212; to providing equal opportunities to talented people, no matter what background they come from.

you probably have experienced the feeling of moving into a nice new apartment or house \u2014 a blank canvas of rooms and spaces filled with possibility. Most times, unless you\u2019ve got that money money, you then fill it up with all of your same, old dinged up furniture.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have had this experience a bunch over the years. When I moved out of my parent\u2019s house, every single piece of furniture I had was thrifted, rescued or gifted. A mash-mash of centuries and styles that was well lived in the day I got it. Even as I got married and even moved much of that same furniture came with.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eventually, much of it began to feel too out of place and we passed it on and carefully bought or made things that we felt represented our home and resonated with us. But there is still that odd piece, like that dinged up dutch modern coffee table, that we look at and remember the sticky cocktail clutter of karaoke nights in our 20\u2019s and the \u2014still sticky \u2014 kid\u2019s snacks of our 30\u2019s.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s where iPad is now. It\u2019s a beautiful new monument to the engineering and hardware teams at Apple that continue to execute at an insane level year over year. But it\u2019s filled with the still functional but feeling its age iPadOS software. And it\u2019s getting more out of place by the day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This writeup has to be about what Apple has currently shipped, of course. That\u2019s what consumers are getting in the mail when they order one now. But, Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference is coming in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/30\/apples-wwdc-stays-online-only-kicking-off-june-7\/\">just a couple of weeks<\/a> and I hope to basically review this iPad Pro all over again in a new light.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154677\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ironically, one of the biggest hardware upgrades for this model is going to elicit a relatively muted response in me here. The M1 chip is <i>absolutely <\/i>blistering. It delivers the same performance as the M1 MacBook Pro did in benchmark tests, making Apple\u2019s lineup more a matter of form factor and use case than raw power. But last year\u2019s model frankly still feels just as fast in almost all of the applications that I tested and certainly in all of my daily workflows. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yes, it\u2019s super powerful and you\u2019re getting the absolute latest in silicon, but upgraders won\u2019t see any immediate difference. In some ways this is by design. In my <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/25\/interview-apple-executives-on-the-2021-ipad-pro-stunting-with-the-m1-and-creating-headroom\/\">interview last month with Apple\u2019s John Ternus and Greg Joswiak<\/a> about the iPad Pro they noted that the new unified processor strategy and the aggressively good display are about creating overhead that they hope developers will take advantage of.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154675\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new iPad Pro cameras are pretty fantastic, both front and back are now <i>very<\/i> usable and the new front camera especially benefits from an increase in resolution and new wide-angle optics. This wide angle makes video calling a bit more relaxed and doable on iPad Pro.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That is coupled with Center Stage, Apple\u2019s new ML-driven feature that automatically crops and centers your head and shoulders, following you around with a smooth and forgiving pan and zoom as you lean, stand and even move about a room within the view of the camera. The feature works by using machine learning frameworks to detect a person\u2019s silhouette within the frame and then applies \u201ccamera moves\u201d to that view as you shift in the frame. Unlike some other auto-zooming features, Center Stage feels like there is a virtual camera operator there helping you to frame yourself properly. It\u2019s really clever and very nicely done \u2014 and it\u2019s one of the biggest upgrades to iPad Pro usability this time around.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/centerstage.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154683\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/centerstage.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"775\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And yes, if you\u2019re wondering, this does a <i>lot<\/i> to mitigate the camera placement issues on iPad Pro. The camera remains in the \u2018top center\u2019 of a vertically oriented iPad Pro, which means that it is on the \u2018middle left\u2019 of a horizontally oriented keyboard-bound setup. This has led to an awkwardness in iPad video calling. Center Stage doesn\u2019t completely delete these issues, hand placement is still a problem at times, but it goes a long way to making it more usable. The new APIs will make this feature available to all video calling apps by the way, and there are also some slight improvements in multi-tasking which let you use multi-pane setups without blanking out your video call in the process of a Zoom.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I tested the external Thunderbolt connection with Apple\u2019s Pro Display XDR and it works fine. The displays are very close in capability so, aside from the scaling, this arrangement could prove to be very useful for pros working in a pipeline with XDR displays for color correction purposes. The software limitation of the iPad Pro only supporting mirror mode is still in effect, alas, which makes the usability of this feature a bit suspect in most situations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Speaking of the screen, the mini-LED driven Liquid Retina XDR display is probably the best display that\u2019s ever shipped on a mobile computer. It\u2019s just fantastic. The daily driving brightness is good, with an average of 600 nit max, but full screen HDR content like videos or photos allow the display to boom up to 1,000 nits average with a peak of 1,600 nits. This thing is b r i g h t. Daylight viewing of HDR content is massively improved. And this comes with inclusion of all of the standard stuff like the 120hz ProMotion features.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The 10,000 mini-LEDs in the display allow for much more precise localization of blacks (because they can turn off completely) and less bloom (though extreme tests still show it). They also provide a noticeably better edge-to-edge uniformity in brightness and improved off-axis viewing of content on the screen. It\u2019s just better in every way. Absolute gold standard display here.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154676\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1088.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple\u2019s new Magic Keyboard works essentially exactly the same as the previous version, but it now comes in white. I\u2019m also happy to report that if you have an existing one it works <i>completely fine<\/i> on the new iPad Pro models. There was some minor uproar because Apple noted that the dimensions of the two devices were not the same so the old keyboard may not fit perfectly. Rest assured that it\u2019s essentially the same exact fit and the functionality is identical. The only time any of it is evident is if you close it and peer very, very carefully at the open end you\u2019ll notice that there is about 1mm less clearance between the rim of the case and the edge of the iPad Pro. Apple probably felt that it was better to over-disclose than anything here but really, it\u2019s not an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The white color is fantastic looking, especially with the silver model of iPad Pro and its white antenna window accents. It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-3949GAIokg\">very 2001<\/a> (even though Kubrik\u2019s iPads were black). I would fully, 100% expect this thing to get marred and dingy though. There\u2019s a warning on the box that \u2018color may transfer\u2019 and I would believe it. My demo unit has not sustained any noticeable markings yet but I would guess that it\u2019s just a matter of time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The overall feel of the keyboard is still great, a really nice typing experience and great little piece of kit that should be factored into the price of purchase of any iPad Pro because it\u2019s just essential.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other side of this coin that isn\u2019t so shiny is the iPad\u2019s aging software. It\u2019s just as good as it was when I wrote my <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/24\/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro\/\">review of the iPad Pro in 2020<\/a> \u2014 at which point my conclusions were \u2018you can adapt to it but it could be better\u2019. That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have a very simple ask for the iPad\u2019s software. I want to feel the same energy vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple\u2019s iPad Pro hardware is performing like an athlete in peak physical condition that is out three lengths ahead. The M1 chip and mini-LED display are really untouchable &#8211; it is exhilarating to see this much excellence packed into one device.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately the software can not cash those checks, leaving this iPad Pro to feel like a perfect house with the same old furniture.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154672\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple has done an incontestably incredible job with the 2021 iPad Pro\u2019s hardware, but it needs to level the software up. As a \u2018power\u2019 user that lives on iPad Pro much of the year, I have grown used to my kludges and tic-affordances. But there needs to be some big time commitment to the iPad paradigm here. The pane-style interface currently has so many things to recommend it as a brutally fast, fluid way to work, but there is no follow through. There is no willingness to say \u2018this is a new way of working and you will learn it.\u2019<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Too much of the iPad Pro\u2019s current software leans into \u2018affordance valley\u2019. A place where users are still treated as if they aren\u2019t capable of learning a touch-first way of working. Instead, these affordances actually do the opposite and stand in the way of progress.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This reminds me of the \u2018reduce animations\u2019 affordance circa the iOS 7 era. When Apple reinvented iOS it went way overboard in animations in order to make it super clear to the user what was happening when they were tapping around the new pane-based interface. Nothing was \u2018slower\u2019 hardware wise but the animated affordances they put in were tuned too far up and made it <i>feel<\/i> slower. Turning those animations off made the interface feel snappier and more useful almost instantly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple eventually got those animations under control by conceding that maybe people were indeed ready to be more advanced touch users.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is where the iPad Pro is currently and it\u2019s the disparity that irks the most. This is one of the best computing hardware devices ever made, and you know it\u2019s capable of so much more than it is currently being let do. Apple has always had an editorial point of view when it comes to software and I can appreciate that. But currently, it feels like that stance is far too conservative when it comes to iPad Pro.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s why I\u2019m waiting for WWDC with bated breath. With this much high-level execution on the hardware side, you have to imagine that the time is ripe for Apple to really take the next leap forward with iPad software. When that happens and we get a solid view of Apple\u2019s vision for the next wave of iPad work, I\u2019ll come back to the table with another look.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154673\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_1091.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019ve lived in a few places in your life then you probably have experienced the feeling of moving into a nice new apartment or house \u2014 a blank canvas of rooms and spaces filled with possibility.

Plus, we didn&#8217;t get to make a joke about it in the show but let&#8217;s just say: Waymo has a waymore to go before it has driverless tech all over the streets.<\/li>\n<li>And one more thing: Kirsten gives a look at some of the speakers at our upcoming mobility event.<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-mobility-2021\/\"> Snag tickets here,<\/a> and subscribe to her newsletter, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/17\/the-station-exits-at-waymo-and-birds-spac-reveals-its-scooter-nomics\/\">The Station<\/a>, for all things mobility every week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And that&#8217;s that!

introduces a new home electric panel"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As energy prices continue to rise and more home owners look to the viability of things like solar, consumers will no doubt be searching for more ways to control their usage. Founded by ex-Tesla engineer Arch Rao, Span looks to address these questions, while asking, in a world of smart home devices, why the end-user access to grid energy has stayed stagnant for so long.<\/p>\n<p>Span is a young company \u2013 founded roughly this time three years ago. This time last year, it raised a $10.1 million Series A, and by the end of the year, was\u00a0 rolling out its products to homes across the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>While not disclosing actual numbers, Rao tells me that Span, is \u201cstarting to capture a meaningful share of the storage market in the U.S. Especially in key markets like California.\u201d Make of that what you will, but the company is particularly targeting solar users with a battery capture system.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Announced today, Span\u2019s second product is a smaller and more versatile unit, simply calling the Span Smart Panel. The system is also notably cheaper than its first-gen predecessor, knocking the $5,000 MSRP down to $3,500. Your results may vary on the price, as power companies will often bundle this technology with other offerings like solar panels.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is part of the original vision that we thought about with Nest,\u201d Nest co-founder and Span investor Matt Rogers said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThere&#8217;s a lot you can do with your home. Nest and Google are heading in different directions. But the opportunity to understand the energy in your home and be the glue and the command center is still really real. Especially in this world where energy costs go up, and where solar and storage become pervasive. You can&#8217;t imagine a world in the future like that, that doesn&#8217;t have something like Span.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The system plays nicely with most home electrical panels and offers minute control for circuits, as well as support for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular and Bluetooth connections. The company offers simple device control through a connected mobile app.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is fundamentally reinvent the home electrical panel,\u201d Rao tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe are not tied to a single use case.

rel=\"noopener\">upswing<\/a> this year, and today a startup that&#8217;s addressing one of homeowners&#8217; biggest needs &#8212; repair and maintenance services, and specifically the stress of sorting these out when things break down &#8212; is announcing some funding on the heels of strong growth.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hellosuper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super<\/a> &#8212; which has built a business providing repair and maintenance for electrical and mechanical systems, appliances, and plumbing by way of a monthly subscription &#8212; has closed a growth round of $50 million.<\/p>\n<p>The startup plans to use the funding to expand into new markets, to hire more people, and to continue adding more maintenance\/repair services and partnerships into its wider home-warranty-by-subscription proposition.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>CEO Jorey Ramer, who co-founded the company with Ryan Donnelly (VP of engineering), also said that another part of the investment will be used to enhance the AI tech that underpins Super&#8217;s service and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hellosuper.com\/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pricing plans<\/a>. More on that below.<\/p>\n<p>The San Francisco-based company is currently active in some of the fastest-growing housing markets in the U.S.,\u00a0 Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Washington, D.C. (ironically not in SF itself), and it has grown revenue 7x since April 2019, when it previously raised money, a<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/17\/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> $20 million Series B<\/a>. It&#8217;s not disclosing actual revenue numbers, nor user numbers.<\/p>\n<p>This is latest Series C has a number of strategic backers that speaks to the bigger ecosystem of financial and insurance services that interlink with each other, and which are used by the average person in the course of home ownership. (Indeed, Super these days seems to refer to itself as an &#8220;insuretech&#8221;.)<\/p>\n<p>Led by Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, the venture arm of the banking giant, others in the round included home construction giant Asahi Kasei, AAA &#8211; Auto Club Group (which also sells insurance), Gaingels, and REACH. The last of these is a scale-up service from Second Century Ventures, which is the investment fund of the National Association of Realtors. Aquiline Technology Growth, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, Moderne Ventures and the HSB Fund of Munich Re Ventures &#8212; which all invested in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/17\/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super&#8217;s previous $20 million round<\/a> back in April 2019 &#8212; also participated.<\/p>\n<p>The company has now raised $80 million in total, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation.<\/p>\n<p>As we have noted before, Ramer came up with the idea for Super when he himself moved to San Francisco after he sold his previous startup, Jumptap \u2014 an advertising network <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/08\/13\/millennial-acquires-jumptap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired by Millennial Media<\/a> (which is now part of Verizon by way of its acquisition of AOL, just like TechCrunch). He&#8217;d been an apartment renter for all of his adult life, but when he moved to the Bay Area, he found himself buying property, and it came with more than a little reluctance because of the headache of taking care of his new home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI liked being a renter,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou pay a fee, and you know what to expect.\u201d (\u201cSuper\u201d is a reference to the superintendents that handle maintenance and repair in an apartment building, and to what Super hopes customers will think about its service.)<\/p>\n<p>The route that Ramer decided to take for how to approach filling that gap, interestingly, is not unlike the challenges that Jumptap faced in the world of ad tech: instead of trying to build a services business from the ground up, he opted to build an integrated network that tapped into a number of small services enterprises already working in the business of maintaining homes. (The correlation here is that, rather than building a first-party behemoth, the approach is to knit together a number of online properties so that people looking to advertise can do so across a wide range of places in a network).<\/p>\n<p>Super has created a kind of marketplace: the services businesses and individuals that Super engages with to carry out maintenance and repairs are all licensed and use its platform for free, essentially, and Super handles remuneration based on call-outs. For users, the call-outs come as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hellosuper.com\/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">part of their monthly plans<\/a>, and they include different options based on which level of service they pay for.<\/p>\n<p>The funding it&#8217;s announcing today will be used in part to enhance how those monthly plans work.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are there algorithms that Super has built to determine how to price its services based on location, size of home and other factors; but there are features in the app that subscribers can use to interact with Super to report issues, call out maintenance people, and provide more detail about problems to improve faster, and in some cases, automated adjudication on issues.<\/p>\n<p>Better tech for more responsive home services has been an interesting area of the market, but one that&#8217;s largely been ignored up to now, but as they have matured, AR and other computer vision breakthroughs have definitely helped to advance that game. (And a number of others are also tapping into that, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/17\/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hover<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/12\/nana-nabs-6m-for-an-online-academy-and-marketplace-dedicated-to-appliance-repair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nana<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jobber<\/a> and more.)<\/p>\n<p>The way that the service has been built to scale &#8212; working with contractors means adding in more kinds of coverage is easier than building from the ground up &#8212; also means that Super over time may well add more services into the mix.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The things we would do are things your super would do,&#8221; Ramer said. &#8220;So that might include fixing plumbing, but might also potentially include cleaning carpets, which you could think of as maintenance.\u00a0Painting is another interesting area. It seems like it might be a cosmetic thing, but if you do not paint, you risk dry rot. It&#8217;s also preventative care. So if we, say, cover 100% maintenance you could imagine that included, too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One area where it&#8217;s unlikely to move is general contract work, say rebuilding a bathroom or kitchen, or adding in a new room in your loft: the focus it seems will remain on the essentials of keeping your home working.<\/p>\n<p>But aside of expanding the services directly on its own platform, there are also potentially opportunities for how Super might work with partners. AAA for example has a notable business not just in roadside assistance but also insurance coverage. Ramer describes Super as &#8220;roadside assistance for your home,&#8221; and he points out that it&#8217;s a natural partnership to sell those alongside each other.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Wells Fargo, as a mortgage lender, is a natural complement, providing a route to its customers to help maintain the properties that they&#8217;re in the process of paying off to the bank. This in turn also becomes a kind of insurance policy to the bank itself, as it keeps the homes it is financing in better shape.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u201cWells Fargo embraces innovation, and we\u2019re excited to support a tech-forward platform like Super which brings further advancement to the home services market,\u201d said Matthew Raubacher, managing director for WFSC\u2019s Principal Technology Investments Group, in a statement. \u201cThe challenges of ongoing repairs and maintenance resonates with every homeowner, and Super provides an experience that is convenient for the customer, while boosting job visibility for local contractors and businesses.

That might not always result in amazing copy, but on the plus side you can always click the button again and give it another try,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Frantz says that with so much competition in the space, he and his co-founder felt they could build a market much faster as part of a larger and broader marketing platform solution like Unbounce.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I love Tamara&#8217;s vision for the future of Unbounce. I think she has a very ambitious vision. She sold me on that very early on in the process. At the same time, there was a lot of competition in the space, and to have a key differentiator with a company like Unbounce, which has a decade of marketing experience and a lot of trust within this community, I think it&#8217;s a very powerful wedge that we can use to further grow our audience,&#8221; Frantz said.<\/p>\n<p>The tool lets you write a range of copy from landing pages to Google ad copy. The company launched in alpha last October and already had 30,000 customers, which Grominsky says Unbounce hopes to convert into customers. The good news for those customers is that the company plans to leave Snazzy as a stand-alone product, while incorporating the tech into the platform in ways that make sense in the coming year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LkG8WqIE2P\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/17\/unbounce-funding\/\">Unbounce raises $38.4M to build better landing pages with automation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Unbounce raises $38.4M to build better landing pages with automation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/17\/unbounce-funding\/embed\/#?secret=LkG8WqIE2P\" data-secret=\"LkG8WqIE2P\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unbounce, a Vancouver startup best known for helping marketers create automated landing pages, added a new wrinkle this morning when it announced it has acquired Snazzy.ai, an early stage automated copywriting startup.

In fact, Pipe claims that its ability to achieve a $2 billion valuation in just under a year since its public launch in June of last year makes it the fastest fintech to reach this valuation in history. While I can\u2019t substantiate that claim, I can say that its growth has indeed been swift and impressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurst, Josh Mangel and Zain Allarakhia founded Pipe in September 2019 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with the mission of giving SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as \u201ca vetted group of financial institutions and banks.\u201d)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the platform is to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they don\u2019t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or get forced to take out loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 4,000 companies have signed up on the Pipe trading platform since its public launch in June 2020, with just over 1,000 of those signing up since its March raise, according to Hurst. Tradable annual<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recurring revenue (ARR) on the Pipe platform is in excess of $1 billion and trending toward $2 billion,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with tens of millions of dollars currently being traded <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every month<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

studio eFounders reaches portfolio valuation of $2 billion"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">European startup studio <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efounders.com\">eFounders<\/a> has now been around for 10 years. And because a birthday sounds like a good opportunity to share some metrics, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efounders.com\/companies\">portfolio companies<\/a> have reached a valuation of $2 billion together \u2014&nbsp;only 18 months after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/08\/startup-studio-efounders-has-a-portfolio-valuation-of-1-billion\/\">reaching<\/a> $1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>eFounders says it is focused on building the future of work. In practical terms, it means the company is building B2B SaaS startups with a focus on productivity and workflows. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/frontapp.com\">Front<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/aircall.io\">Aircall<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spendesk.com\">Spendesk<\/a> all started with eFounders.<\/p>\n<p>There have been a few exits, such as TextMaster, Mention, Mailjet, Hivy and Briq. Those exits are included in the total valuation of eFounders companies \u2014&nbsp; exit values are freezed as of date of exit. But Front, Aircall and Spendesk could represent even more massive successes down the road.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhen we started in 2011, there was an existing model that was Rocket Internet. We liked the entrepreneurship spirit but we didn\u2019t like the philosophy,\u201d co-founder and CEO Thibaud Elzi\u00e8re told me.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of copying Rocket Internet altogether, they altered the business model quite drastically on three different aspects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They try to come up with original startup ideas, not copycats;<\/li>\n<li>They want to work with entrepreneurs, not consultants-turned-entrepreneurs;<\/li>\n<li>Their portfolio companies should be able to operate on their own after 12 to 18 months.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When eFounders come up with a new project, they act as a sort of third co-founder. The startup studio tries to find a CEO and a CTO. In exchange for a third of equity, the eFounders core team helps take the project off the ground. When the startup raises a seed round, eFounders moves on from day-to-day activities and focuses on new projects.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s been working well. With 30 portfolio companies, there are now 1,500 people working for an eFounders-backed company. Combined, they generate $131 million in annual recurring revenue.<\/p>\n<p>As for the next 10 years, Elzi\u00e8re doesn\u2019t think eFounders can simply increase the cadence and launch more and more projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a model that isn\u2019t scalable \u2014 it\u2019s hand crafted,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to expand. First, eFounders is going to focus on more verticals. That\u2019s why the startup studio partnered with Camille Tyan so that he would be in charge of fintech projects. You can imagine another studio for blockchain startups, another one for AI startups, etc.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to remain focused on software with a B2B angle \u2014 not enterprise but long-tail B2B.

the privacy startup behind e2e encrypted ProtonMail, confirms passing 50M users"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">End-to-end encrypted email provider ProtonMail has officially confirmed it&#8217;s passed 50 million users globally as it turns seven years old.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a notable milestone for a services provider that intentionally does not have a data business \u2014 opting instead for a privacy pledge based on zero access architecture that means it has no way to decrypt the contents of ProtonMail users\u2019 emails.<\/p>\n<p>Although, to be clear, the 50M+ figure applies to total users of all its products (which includes a VPN offering), not just users of its e2e encrypted email. (It declined to break out email users vs other products when we asked.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, Andy Yen, founder and CEO, said: \u201cThe conversation about privacy has shifted surprisingly quickly in the past seven years. Privacy has gone from being an afterthought, to the main focus of a lot of discussions about the future of the Internet. In the process, Proton has gone from a crowdfunded idea of a better Internet, to being at the forefront of the global privacy wave. Proton is an alternative to the surveillance capitalism model advanced by Silicon Valley&#8217;s tech giants, that allows us to put the needs of users and society first.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"d5rrGBcug4\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/14\/e2e-encrypted-email-providers-also-see-sign-ups-surge-as-chat-app-users-flock-to-signal-and-telegram-in-search-of-privacy\/\">E2E encrypted email providers also see sign-ups surge as chat app users flock to Signal and Telegram in search of privacy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;E2E encrypted email providers also see sign-ups surge as chat app users flock to Signal and Telegram in search of privacy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/14\/e2e-encrypted-email-providers-also-see-sign-ups-surge-as-chat-app-users-flock-to-signal-and-telegram-in-search-of-privacy\/embed\/#?secret=d5rrGBcug4\" data-secret=\"d5rrGBcug4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>ProtonMail, which was founded in 2014, has diversified into offering a suite of products \u2014 including the aforementioned VPN and a calendar offering (<a href=\"https:\/\/protonmail.com\/blog\/protoncalendar-beta-announcement\/\">Proton Calendar<\/a>). A cloud storage service, <a href=\"https:\/\/protonmail.com\/blog\/proton-drive-early-access\/\">Proton Drive<\/a>, is also slated for public release later this year.<\/p>\n<p>For all these products it claims take the same &#8216;zero access&#8217; hands off approach to user data. Albeit, it&#8217;s a bit of an apples and oranges comparison to compare e2e encrypted email with an encrypted VPN service &#8212; since the issue with VPN services is that they can see activity (i.e. where the encrypted or otherwise packets are going) and that metadata can sum to a log of your Internet activity (even with e2e encryption of the packets themselves).<\/p>\n<p>Proton claims it doesn\u2019t track or record its VPN users\u2019 web browsing. And given its wider privacy-dependent reputation that&#8217;s at least a more credible claim vs the average VPN service. Nonetheless, you do still have to trust Proton not to do that (or be forced to do that by, for e.g., law enforcement). It&#8217;s not the same technical &#8216;zero access&#8217; guarantee as it can offer for its e2e encrypted email.<\/p>\n<p>Proton does also offer a free VPN &#8212; which, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/01\/wtf-is-a-vpn\/\">we&#8217;ve said before<\/a>, can be a red flag for data logging risk &#8212; but the company specifies that users of the paid version subsidize free users. So, again, the <em>claim<\/em> is zero logging but you still need to make a judgement call on whether to trust that.<\/p>\n<h2>From Snowden to 50M+<\/h2>\n<p>Over ProtonMail&#8217;s seven year run privacy has certainly gained cache as a brand promise &#8212; which is why you can now see data-mining giants like Facebook making ludicrous claims about &#8216;pivoting&#8217; their people-profiling surveillance empires to &#8216;privacy&#8217;. So, as ever, PR that&#8217;s larded with claims of &#8216;respect for privacy&#8217; demands very close scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>And while it&#8217;s clearly absurd for an adtech giant like Facebook to try to cloak the fact that its business model relies on stripping away people&#8217;s privacy with claims to the contrary, in Proton&#8217;s case the privacy claim is very strong indeed &#8212; since the company was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/06\/23\/protonmail-is-a-swiss-secure-mail-provider-that-wont-give-you-up-to-the-nsa\/\">founded with the goal of being &#8220;immune to large scale spying&#8221;<\/a>. Spying such as that carried out by the NSA.<\/p>\n<p>ProtonMail&#8217;s founding idea was to build a system &#8220;that does not require trusting us&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While usage of e2e encryption has grown enormously since 2013 &#8212; when disclosures by NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, revealed the extent of data gathering by government mass surveillance programs, which were shown (il)liberally tapping into Internet cables and mainstream digital services to grab people\u2019s data without their knowledge or consent &#8212; growth that&#8217;s certainly been helped by consumer friendly services like ProtonMail making robust encryption far more accessible &#8212; there are worrying moves by lawmakers in a number of jurisdictions that clash with the core idea and threaten access to e2e encryption.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of the Snowden disclosures, &#8216;Five Eyes&#8217; countries steadily <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/25\/australia-wants-five-eyes-to-squeeze-tech-firms-on-encryption\/\">amped up international political pressure on e2e encryption<\/a>. Australia, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/05\/australia-rushes-its-dangerous-anti-encryption-bill-into-parliament\/\">passed an anti-encryption law in 2018<\/a> &#8212; which grants police powers to issue &#8216;technical notices&#8217; to force companies operating on its soil to help the government hack, implant malware, undermine encryption or insert backdoors at the behest of the government.<\/p>\n<p>While, in 2016, the UK <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/29\/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption\/\">reaffirmed its surveillance regime<\/a> &#8212; passing a law that gives the government powers to compel companies to remove or not implement e2e encryption. Under the Investigatory Powers Act, a statutory instrument called a <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/05\/uk-surveillance-law-still-fuzzy-on-decryption-rules-for-comms-providers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technical Capability Notice<\/a> (TCN) can be served on comms services providers to compel decrypted access. (And as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openrightsgroup.org\/blog\/endgame-for-end-to-end-encryption\/\">ORG<\/a> noted in April, there&#8217;s no way to track usage as the law gags providers from reporting anything at all about a TCN application, including that it even exists.)<\/p>\n<p>More recently, UK ministers have kept up public pressure on e2e encryption &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56795852\">framing it as an existential threat to child protection<\/a>. Simultaneously they are legislating &#8212; via an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill\/\">Online Safety Bill, out in draft earlier this month<\/a> &#8212; to put a legally binding obligation on service providers to &#8216;prevent bad things from happening on the Internet&#8217; (as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openrightsgroup.org\/blog\/online-harms-encryption-under-attack\/\">ORG<\/a> neatly sums it up). And while still at the draft stage, private messaging services are in scope of that bill &#8212; putting the law on a potential collision course with messaging services that use e2e encryption.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S., meanwhile, has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/16\/senate-fisa-section-702-cloture-vote-wyden-paul\/\">declined to reform warrantless surveillance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And if you think the EU is a safe space for e2e encryption, there are reasons to be concerned in continental Europe too.<\/p>\n<p>EU lawmakers have recently made a push for what they describe as &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/09\/on-encryption-and-counter-terrorism-eu-lawmakers-say-theyll-work-for-lawful-data-access\/\">lawful access<\/a>&#8221; to encrypted data \u2014 without specifying exactly how that might be achieved, i.e. without breaking and\/or backdooring e2e encryption and therefore undoing the digital security they also say is vital.<\/p>\n<p>In a further worrying development, EU lawmakers have proposed automated scanning of encrypted communications services \u2014 aka a provision called \u2018chatcontrol\u2019 that\u2019s ostensibly targeted at prosecuting those who share child exploitation content \u2014 which raises further questions over how such laws might intersect with &#8216;zero access&#8217; services like ProtonMail.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/european-pirateparty.eu\/the-end-of-the-privacy-of-digital-correspondence\/\">European Pirate Party<\/a> has been sounding the alarm &#8212; and dubs the &#8216;chatcontrol&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/RegData\/docs_autres_institutions\/commission_europeenne\/com\/2020\/0568\/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf\">proposal<\/a> &#8220;the end of the privacy of digital correspondence&#8221; &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patrick-breyer.de\/en\/posts\/message-screening\/\">warning<\/a> that &#8220;securely encrypted communication is at risk&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A plenary vote on the proposal is expected in the coming months &#8212; so where exactly the EU lands on that remains to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>ProtonMail, meanwhile, is based in Switzerland which is not a member of the EU and has one of the stronger reputations for privacy laws globally. However the country also backed beefed-up surveillance powers<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/26\/swiss-public-back-law-expanding-surveillance-powers\/\">\u00a0in 2016<\/a> &#8212; extending the digital snooping capabilities of its own intelligence agencies.<\/p>\n<p>It does also adopt some EU regulations &#8212; so, again, it&#8217;s not clear whether or not any pan-EU automated scanning of message content could end up being applied to services based in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The threats to e2e encryption are certainly growing, even as usage of such properly private services keeps scaling.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether it has concerns, ProtonMail pointed out that the EU&#8217;s current temporary chatcontrol proposal is voluntary &#8212; meaning it would be up to the company in question to decide its own policy. Although it accepts there is &#8220;some support&#8221; in the Commission for the chatcontrol proposals to be made mandatory.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s not clear at this time whether these proposals could impact Proton specifically [i.e. if they were to become mandatory],&#8221; the spokesman also told us. &#8220;The extent to which a Swiss company like Proton might be impacted by such efforts would have to be assessed based on the specific legal proposal. To our knowledge, none has been made for now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We completely agree that steps have to be taken to combat the spread of illegal explicit material. However, our concern is that the forced scanning of communications would be an ineffective approach and would instead have the unintended effect of undermining many of the basic freedoms that the EU was established to protect,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Any form of automated content scanning is incompatible with end-to-end encryption and by definition undermines the right to privacy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So while Proton is rightly celebrating that a steady commitment to zero access infrastructure over the past seven years has helped its business grow to 50M+ users, there are reasons for all privacy-minded folk to be watchful of what the next years of political developments might mean for the privacy and security of all our data.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"M6mvIagazU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/27\/protonmail-threema-tresorit-and-tutanota-warn-eu-lawmakers-against-anti-encryption-push\/\">ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota warn EU lawmakers over &#8216;anti-encryption&#8217; push<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota warn EU lawmakers over &#8216;anti-encryption&#8217; push&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/27\/protonmail-threema-tresorit-and-tutanota-warn-eu-lawmakers-against-anti-encryption-push\/embed\/#?secret=M6mvIagazU\" data-secret=\"M6mvIagazU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NUNGt3Y3jn\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/09\/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors\/\">What&#8217;s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/09\/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors\/embed\/#?secret=NUNGt3Y3jn\" data-secret=\"NUNGt3Y3jn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>End-to-end encrypted email provider ProtonMail has officially confirmed it&#8217;s passed 50 million users globally as it turns seven years old.

launches a virtual concert series with The Black Keys and more"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The past year has been utterly devastating to the music industry generally, and live music in particular. Artists who make a living touring have been forced to find alternative ways to make ends meet, while those among us who once frequented live events have been looking for ways to plug the hole created by wide-scale shutdowns.<\/p>\n<p>A number of music-related platforms have spent much of the pandemic looking to offer some semblance of the concert-going experience, ranging from live venues to services like Bandcamp. Today, Spotify is announcing<a href=\"https:\/\/www.spotify.live\/\"> the launch of a new feature<\/a> designed to provide a live-show experience remotely. Venues in many areas are beginning to reopen, but even fans may be cautious to return to packed, indoor events.<\/p>\n<p>The streaming service is announcing a series of shows starting with dates this month and next, including names like The Black Keys, Rag&#8217;n&#8217;Bone Man, Bleachers\u2019 Jack Antonoff, Leon Bridges and girl in red. Spotify is billing them as \u201cprerecorded livestreams\u201d &#8212; a bit of an oxymoron, that. I recognize that livestream has become kind of a catchall, but it loses some meaning when the thing isn\u2019t, you know, live.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Rather than streaming straight from a venue, the service is taking the somewhat novel approach of letting the artist choose the spot for the pre-recorded show. That means live-show venues in the case of The Black Keys and something more creative for Antonoff, who shot his segment on a bus traveling from Brooklyn to Springsteen\u2019s old stomping ground, Asbury Park, New Jersey (greetings).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tB3UM16rkm\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/02\/are-virtual-concerts-here-to-stay\/\">Are virtual concerts here to stay?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Are virtual concerts here to stay?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/02\/are-virtual-concerts-here-to-stay\/embed\/#?secret=tB3UM16rkm\" data-secret=\"tB3UM16rkm\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe have always been a band that loves to play live in venues of all shapes and sizes,\u201d The Black Keys said in a release tied to the news. \u201cThe past year has been tough for musicians and fans alike, so we wanted to find a way to share this live performance of songs from our new project, <em>Delta Kream<\/em>, from a place we love, the Blue Front Caf\u00e9, the oldest active juke joint in America. We\u2019re excited to be a part of this new initiative with Spotify that will give fans a great way to connect with their favorite artists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The shows run 40-75 minutes and run $15 a pop.

there\u2019s a pretty good chance you have a LinkedIn profile with your digital resume and hundreds &#8212; if not thousands &#8212; of professional connections. But how many of those people do you actually know well, and, more importantly, do you ever connect with them and meet others from their networks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou don\u2019t go to LinkedIn to meet people. You don\u2019t hang out and spend meaningful time there,\u201d said Alex Taub, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/upstreamapp.com\/\">Upstream<\/a>, a new professional networking platform that just closed a $2.75 million seed round, bringing their total raised to $3.25 million. The round was led by Ibex Investors and managing partner Nicole Priel (who joins the board) and includes participation by 8-Bit Capital, Human Ventures, NYVP, Converge Venture Partners and a number of angel investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYour LinkedIn network is not a good representation of who you actually know and how well you know them. We see these places that LinkedIn isn\u2019t particularly focused [on] and believe there are opportunities for multiple big companies to better serve the needs of professionals,\u201d Taub added.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike LinkedIn, Upstream focuses on generating meaningful connections between its members, and one way they go about it is by hosting digital events that start with a speaker, followed by breakout matched sessions that are five minutes each.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get a sense of the product, Upstream invited me to be the speaker at last Friday\u2019s \u201cUpstream Social,\u201d where I talked about my work as a journalist and then coincidently got matched with two founders &#8212; one in Brazil and the other in Boston. The week before, the guest speaker was U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OyjW6G2tVS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/23\/6-miami-based-investors-share-their-views-on-the-regions-startup-scene\/\">8 Miami-based investors share their views on the region&#8217;s startup scene<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;8 Miami-based investors share their views on the region&#8217;s startup scene&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/23\/6-miami-based-investors-share-their-views-on-the-regions-startup-scene\/embed\/#?secret=OyjW6G2tVS\" data-secret=\"OyjW6G2tVS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, the experience felt like LinkedIn meets Clubhouse meets Hoppin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upstream, which is pre-revenue and is Miami-based, is a company whose founder was attracted to the Sunshine State from NYC during the pandemic. Taub and his family signed a two-year lease here and plan to reevaluate their residence in the summer of 2022; they are one of the movers who are cautiously optimistic about the tech industry\u2019s recent explosion in the Magic City.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The origin story<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taub and his co-founder, Michael Schonfeld, are both serial entrepreneurs, having built and sold Social Rank for an undisclosed amount before launching Upstream in October 2020. The impetus for the company came as a solution to a struggle Taub faced in his daily life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThroughout my life, regardless of the job I\u2019ve been in, I spend my time making introductions, connecting people and helping friends hire rock-star talent. Like many people, I get energy from helping others,\u201d Taub said. \u201cWhen COVID-19 hit and the job market took a dive last March, the number of requests for help I received increased 100X. I noticed quickly that my speed of responding to emails and brain capacity to connect the dots became the limiting factor in getting people help,\u201d he added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it\u2019s no surprise that Upstream started as a product where people could ask for help, and others from the community pitched in. The company now has more than 200 communities (similar to LinkedIn groups), and about 75% of the people who attend an initial Upstream event return for a second one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI joke that we are building a product that people need because I need it. We feel that we are the right team to solve this problem because we so desperately want it ourselves,\u201d Taub said.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"e9Vk7LtFdn\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/accessing-social-groups-through-referrals\/\">Accessing social groups through referrals<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Accessing social groups through referrals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/accessing-social-groups-through-referrals\/embed\/#?secret=e9Vk7LtFdn\" data-secret=\"e9Vk7LtFdn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re reading this, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you have a LinkedIn profile with your digital resume and hundreds &#8212; if not thousands &#8212; of professional connections.

The nation\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has once again directed the Facebook-owned company to withdraw the planned update.<\/p>\n<p>In a letter to WhatsApp on Tuesday &#8212; which was read to TechCrunch &#8212; MeitY has given the popular instant messaging provider seven days to offer a \u201csatisfactory\u201d response. Failure to do so, the ministry warned, will prompt lawful measures.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn fulfilment of its sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens, the government of India will consider various options available to it under laws in India,\u201d the letter reads.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The letter comes at a time when the ministry is also pursuing a legal case on this matter in the Delhi High Court &#8212; and \u00a0the second largest internet market is also<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/24\/india-antitrust-body-orders-investigation-into-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes\/\"> conducting an antitrust probe on the subject<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first time New Delhi has issued a notice to WhatsApp about the new privacy terms. Earlier this year, in a similar letter,&#8221; the Indian government had expressed &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/19\/india-asks-whatsapp-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-expresses-grave-concerns\/\">grave concerns<\/a>&#8221; about the planned update.<\/p>\n<p>Following backlash from several governments and users, WhatsApp earlier this year\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/15\/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15\/\">delayed enforcement of the privacy update<\/a> by three months &#8212; to May 15. Last week, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/06\/whatsapp-is-doing-fine-despite-months-long-backlash-over-policy-update\/\">somewhat relaxed the deadline<\/a>, though users need to still need to comply to access some basic features.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson at the time told TechCrunch that the vast majority of users who had seen the new privacy terms on the app had accepted it.<\/p>\n<p>With over 450 million users, India is WhatsApp\u2019s biggest market by users.<\/p>\n<p>The ministry in its notice this week has asked WhatsApp why it needs to enforce the new changes to its terms of service &#8212; the first major update in years &#8212; to users in India when those in the EU have been exempted from it.<\/p>\n<p>The updated privacy terms grant WhatsApp the consent to share some personal information &#8212; such as their phone number and location &#8212; with parent firm Facebook. WhatsApp has clarified that communication between two individuals remains just as private as before.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not just problematic, but also irresponsible, for WhatsApp to leverage this position to impose unfair terms and conditions on Indian users, particularly those that discriminate against Indian users vis-\u00e0-vis users in Europe,\u201d the ministry wrote in the letter.<\/p>\n<p>In response to a petition filed in the Delhi High Court earlier this month, WhatsApp argued that many Indian firms <a href=\"https:\/\/inc42.com\/buzz\/exclusive-whatsapp-says-zomato-ola-koo-bigbasket-among-others-collect-as-much-or-more-data\/\">maintain similar policies and share more data<\/a>. In the petition, WhatsApp had identified food delivery startup Zomato, ride-hailing giant Ola, online grocer BigBasket, as well as Swedish giant Truecaller, which counts India as its largest market by users, as some examples.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Indian government is not pleased with WhatsApp\u2019s new privacy policy.

workplace, but that has slowly been changing. Trends in automation, big data, and AI have not only ushered in a new wave of project management applications, but they have led to a stronger culture of people willing to use them. Today, one of the startups building a platform for the next generation of project management is announcing some funding &#8212; a sign of the traction it&#8217;s getting in the market.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forecast.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forecast<\/a>, a platform and startup of the same name that uses AI to help with project management and resource planning &#8212; put simply, it uses artificial intelligence to both &#8220;read&#8221; and integrate data from different enterprise applications in order to build a bigger picture of the project and potential outcomes &#8212; has raised $19 million to continue building out its business.<\/p>\n<p>The company plans to use some of the funding to expand to the U.S., and some to continue building out its platform and business, headquartered in London with a development office also in Copenhagen.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This funding, a Series A, comes less than a year after the startup&#8217;s commercial launch, and it was led by\u00a0Balderton Capital, with previous investors Crane Ventures Partners, SEED Capital and Heartcore also participating.<\/p>\n<p>Forecast closed a seed round in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/01\/forecast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">November 2019<\/a> and then launched just as the pandemic was kicking off. It was a time when some projects were indeed put on ice, but others that went ahead did so with more caution on all sorts of fronts &#8212; financial, organizational, and technical. It turned out to be a &#8220;right place, right time&#8221; moment for Forecast, a tool that plays directly into providing a technical platform to manage all of that in a better way, and it tripled revenues during the year. Its customers include the likes of the NHS, the Red Cross, Etain and more. It says over 150,000 projects have been created and run through its platform to date.<\/p>\n<p>Project management &#8212; the process of planning what you need to do, assigning resources to the task and tracking how well all of that actually goes to plan &#8212; has long been stuck between a rock and a hard place in the world of work.<\/p>\n<p>It can be essential to getting things done, especially when there are multiple departments or stakeholders involved; yet it&#8217;s forever an inexact science that often does not reflect all the complexities of an actual project, and therefore may not be as useful as it could or should be.<\/p>\n<p>This was a predicament that founder and CEO Dennis Kayser knew all too well, having been an engineer and technical lead on a number of big projects himself. His pedigree is an interesting one: one of his early jobs was as a developer at Varien, where he built the first version of Magento. (The company was <a href=\"https:\/\/inchoo.net\/magento\/varien-is-now-magento-inc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eventually rebranded as Magento<\/a> and then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebayinc.com\/stories\/news\/ebay-inc-completes-acquisition-magento\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired by eBay<\/a>, then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20151102006822\/en\/eBay-Completes-Sale-eBay-Enterprise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spun out<\/a>, then <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/21\/adobe-to-acquire-magento-for-1-6-b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired again, this time by Adobe<\/a> for nearly $1.7 billion, and now a huge player in the world of e-commerce tools.) He also spent years as a consultant at IBM, where among other things he helped build and formulate the first versions of ikea.com.<\/p>\n<p>In those and other projects, he saw the pitfalls of project management <em>not<\/em> done right &#8212; not just in terms of having the right people on a project at the right time, but the resource planning needed, better calculations of financial outcomes in the event of a decision going one way or the other, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>(He didn&#8217;t say this outright, but I&#8217;m sure one of the points of contention was the fact that the first ikea.com site didn&#8217;t actually have any e-commerce in it, just a virtual window display of sorts. That would have been because Ikea wanted to keep people shopping in its stores, away from the efficiency of just buying the one thing you actually need and not the 10 you do not. Yes, there are plenty of ways now of recirculating people to buy more when you select one item for a shopping cart &#8212; something the likes of Amazon has totally mastered &#8212; but this was years ago when there was still even more opportunities for innovation than there are now. All of this is to say that you might very reasonably argue that had there been better project managing and resource planning tools to give forecasts of potential outcomes of one or another route taken, people advocating for a different approach could have made their case better. And maybe Ikea would have jumped on board with digital commerce far sooner than it did.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Typically you get a lot of spreadsheets, people scattered across different tools that include accounting, CRM, Gitlab and more,&#8221; Kayser said.<\/p>\n<p>That became the impetus for trying to build something that can take all of that into account and make a project management tool that &#8212; rather than just being a way of accounting to a higher-up, or reflecting only what someone can be bothered to update in the system &#8212; something that can help a team.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Connecting everything into our engine, we leverage data to understand what they are working on and what is the right thing to be working on, what the finances are looking like,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So if you work in product, you can plan out who is where, and what resourcing you need, what kind of people and skills you require.&#8221; This is a more dynamic progression of some of the other newer tools that are being used for project management today, targeting, in his words, &#8220;people who graduate from Monday and Asana who need something ore robust, either because they have too many people working on a project or because its too complicated, there is just too much stuff to handle.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>More legacy tools he said that are used include Oracle &#8220;to some degree&#8221; and Mavenlink, which he describes as possibly Forecast&#8217;s closest competitor, &#8220;but its platform is aging.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Currently the Forecast platform has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forecast.app\/integrations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some 26 integrations<\/a> of popular tools used for projects to produce its insights and intelligence, including Salesforce, Gitlab, Google Calendar, and, as it happens, Asana. But given how fragmented the market is, and the signals one might gain from any number of other resources and apps, I suspect that this list will grow as and when its customers need more supported, or Forecast works out what can be gleaned from different places to paint an even more accurate picture.<\/p>\n<p>The result may not ever replace an actual human project manager, but certainly starts to then look like a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; (a phrase I have been hearing more and more these days) that will definitely help that person, and the rest of the team, work in a smarter way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are really excited to be an early investor in Forecast,&#8221; said James Wise,\u00a0 a partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement. \u201cWe share their belief that the next generation of SaaS products will be more than just collaboration tools, but use machine learning to actively solve problems for their users. The feedback we got from Forecast&#8217;s customers was quite incredible, both in their praise for the platform and in how much of a difference it had already made to their operations. We look forward to supporting the company to scale this impact going forward.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Project management has long been a people-led aspect of the workplace, but that has slowly been changing.
